## 🎯 Purpose

These prompts help you:
- **Standardize** AI interactions across your development workflow
- **Improve** the quality and consistency of AI-generated code
- **Accelerate** development by having ready-to-use prompt templates
- **Collaborate** effectively by sharing proven prompt patterns with your team

## 💡 How to Use

1. **Choose the appropriate category** based on your task
2. **Open the relevant prompt file** in that category
3. **Copy the prompt template** and fill in the placeholders
4. **Paste into your AI assistant** (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot Chat, etc.)
5. **Iterate and refine** based on the AI's response

## 🔧 Customization

Each prompt template includes:
- **Context sections**: Provide background information
- **Task descriptions**: Clear objectives for the AI
- **Constraints**: Guidelines and requirements
- **Output format**: Expected structure of the response
- **Examples**: Sample inputs/outputs when applicable

Feel free to modify these templates to match your:
- Programming language preferences
- Coding standards and conventions
- Project-specific requirements
- Team workflows

## 🌐 AI Compatibility

These prompts are designed with compatibility in mind:

- **Format**: Plain text with markdown formatting
- **Structure**: Clear sections and instructions
- **Language**: Standard English without platform-specific commands
- **Flexibility**: Adaptable to different AI models and their capabilities

### Tested with:
- ✅ ChatGPT (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o)
- ✅ Claude (Claude 3, Claude 3.5)
- ✅ GitHub Copilot Chat
- ✅ Google Gemini
- ✅ Other instruction-following LLMs

## 📚 Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear context and requirements
2. **Use Examples**: Include sample inputs/outputs when possible
3. **Set Constraints**: Define what to avoid or limitations
4. **Iterate**: Refine prompts based on results
5. **Version Control**: Track prompt changes like code
6. **Share Knowledge**: Document what works well for your team

## 🚀 Getting Started

Start with these common scenarios:

1. **New Feature**: Use `code-generation/feature-template.md`
2. **Bug Fix**: Use `debugging/bug-investigation.md`
3. **Code Review**: Use `code-review/review-checklist.md`
4. **Tests**: Use `testing/unit-test-generation.md`
5. **Docs**: Use `documentation/api-documentation.md`

## 🤝 Contributing

To add new prompts:
1. Choose the appropriate category folder
2. Create a descriptive filename (e.g., `authentication-setup.md`)
3. Follow the template structure used in existing prompts
4. Test with multiple AI systems if possible
5. Document any platform-specific notes
